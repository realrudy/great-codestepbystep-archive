Date-absoluteDay
Language/Type:Java

Write a method named absoluteDay that will be placed in the Date class. The method should return the "absolute day of the year" between 1 and 365 represented by the Date object. January 1 is absolute day #1, January 2 is day #2, ..., and December 31st is absolute day #365. For example, calling this method on a date representing February 13th should return 44, and calling it on a Date representing September 19th should return 263. The table below summarizes the absolute days for various dates throughout the year.

Date (month/day)	1/1	1/2	1/3	...	1/30	1/31	2/1	2/2	...	2/28	3/1	3/2	...	12/30	12/31
Absolute day	1	2	3	...	30	31	32	33	...	59	60	61	...	364	365
The following table shows the results of calling your method on several Date objects.

Object	Call	Returns
Date jan1 = new Date(1, 1);	jan1.absoluteDay()	1
Date jan4 = new Date(1, 4);	jan4.absoluteDay()	4
Date feb1 = new Date(2, 1);	feb1.absoluteDay()	32
Date mar10 = new Date(3, 10);	mar10.absoluteDay()	69
Date sep19 = new Date(9, 19);	sep19.absoluteDay()	262
Date dec31 = new Date(12, 31);	dec31.absoluteDay()	365
You should not solve this problem by writing 12 if statements, one for each month; this is redundant and poor style.

Recall that your method is allowed to call other methods on Date objects or construct other objects if you like.
